<h1>FAQ for the PUSH LAP app</h1>

<h2>Why is the new race not displayed in the app?</h2>
<p>New races (including individual sessions as part of a race weekend) are added up to 30 minutes befeore the scheduled start as this is when the official data provider starts emitting data. We appreciate your patience.
</p>
<h2>Are new features planned for the app?</h2>
<p>Yes, this is only a first iteration of the app, more exciting features are expected to come to the app in the near future. So stay tuned for that!

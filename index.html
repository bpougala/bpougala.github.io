# FAQ for the PUSH LAP app

## Why is the new race not displayed in the app?
New races (including individual sessions as part of a race weekend) are added up to 30 minutes befeore the scheduled start as this is when the official data provider starts emitting data. We appreciate your patience.

## Are new features planned for the app?
Yes, this is only a first iteration of the app, more exciting features are expected to come to the app in the near future. So stay tuned for that!

## How can I make suggestions about the app?
Feel free to reach out to the dev team at formulatelemetry@gmail.com if you have any suggestions.
